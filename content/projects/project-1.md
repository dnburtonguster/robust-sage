> My custom jewelry gives everyone what they want, whether it's earrings, bracelets, or necklaces. Prices are low, jewelry is great, and my jewelry lasts a long time.
>
> I make jewelry for kids and adults. People may receive volcanic rock, glass, and metal. People may also receive plastic beads. People may receive their jewelry in at least 3-5 days. 
>
> The jewelry is handled with care. You receive the jewelry in either a small cardboard box or an envelope depending on how many pieces of jewelry you choose to receive.
